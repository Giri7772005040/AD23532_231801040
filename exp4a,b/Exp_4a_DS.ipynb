After paying $15.00 shipping, it took several weeks to receive since they only put $4.22 postage on it to cover the media mail charge. Plus they shipped it 2 weeks after I paid. So they overcharged me $10 for shipping AND dragged their feet in shipping it. I would avoid using them for any type of mail order. Says a lot about their business ethics, or lack thereof.\n",

Our main entrees were delivered to the table before our appetizer and salads. I can understand having problems if it's busy but it wasn't. I'm very disappointed in everything about this restaurant. We won't be coming back unless we have to, and if we do, we'll make sure we eat somewhere else first.\n",
